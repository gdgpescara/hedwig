## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── feature-x/
│   │   └── ComponentName.astro
│   │   └── AnotherComponentName.astro 
│   ├── shared/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/feature-x/`, (replace "x" with any component name that you want)  but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components or something related to the feature.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## 🧞 Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command             | Action                                           |
