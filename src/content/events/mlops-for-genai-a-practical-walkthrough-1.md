LLMs and GenAI are new and rapidly developing areas of AI. And MLOps is the key to deploying GenAI applications to production. In this session, we will walk through a practical example of how to implement MLOps for GenAI on Vertex AI. We will cover everything from data preparation to model tuning, reinforcement learning with human feedback and deployment. By the end of this session, you will have the skills and knowledge you need to implement MLOps for your own GenAI applications on Vertex AI.
