It would be great to have a bunch of spells ready to be used to overcome any issue, delay, or conflict during the lifecycle of a project! Do you agree? Unfortunately, those spells are not available yet, but I will show you how to use your magic powder (soft skills) to manage one of the most important resources in a project, to successfully deliver a project on time, within budget, and to the required quality...that important resource is your stakeholders. ATTENTION: This session is not only for project managers. If you have a position that demands leadership or if you want to become a project manager, you can't miss this session!
