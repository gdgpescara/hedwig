Let's dive into every developer's worst nightmare: end-to-end (e2e) testing. While in Web2 we got used to testing to ensure that the entire application, from the user interface to the backend systems, functions correctly and seamlessly. Web3 has a different setup and testing applications requires an understanding of blockchain technology, smart contracts and how to deal with Web3 tools. In this talk we will explore everything you need to know with a hands-on demonstration that showcases how to test your own Web3 applications effectively.
