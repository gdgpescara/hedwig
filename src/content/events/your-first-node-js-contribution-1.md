Have you ever wanted to contribute to a foundational open source project like Node.js? Maybe you don’t know where to start. Maybe you always assumed that was work reserved for “someone else.” Join experienced contributors who will guide you through your first (or second or third or fourth) commit to the Node.js core. They will be available to help troubleshoot any development environment issues and also to provide guided tours through specific areas of the Node.js core source code. Contributors of all skill levels and experiences are welcome (not every contribution has to be a code change). Come and make your first Node.js core contribution!
