Hello there! Riccardo, also known as TheZal here! I'm the guy behind the code at Revolt Srl, and I'm all about writing awesome code and spreading the open source love.
You might have stumbled upon my corner of the internet – thezal.dev. That's where I hang out and chat with fellow developers. I write about coding tips, cool tricks, and the latest trends to keep everyone in the loop.
But wait, there's more to me than just coding! I'm a massive Marvel Comics fan – superheroes and their journeys truly light up my day. And guess what? I'm also a Dungeons and Dragons enthusiast. I get to be both the player and the master of epic adventures, fueling my creativity and thinking outside the box.
Open source is where it's at for me. I believe in working together to make software better for everyone. I get my hands dirty by actively contributing to open source projects, because collaboration is what drives real progress.
