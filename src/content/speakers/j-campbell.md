Hi,  my name is Jai,   I am a software engineer and active member of various technical communities varying from Women Techmakers,  open source enablement and visibility, GDG and GDE.
I work mainly on GCP application and infrastructure modernisation projects for all types of organisations.  I have been working in financial services for the last 3 years as an SRE/Architect enabling clients to move existing and deploy new workloads into the Cloud.
